/*!
 * This is the interface of the plugin. It inehrite from both QObject and PluginInterface.
 * 
 * Since PluginInterface is an abstract class, this one have to override 4 functions:
 *  - `pluginProps()` which give to Sielo all informations needed about the plugin.
 *  - `init(InitState state, const QString& settingsPath)` which is called at the loading of the plugin.
 *  - `unload()` which is called when the plugin is unloaded.
 *  - `testPlugin()` who allows Sielo to check if it can load the plugin or not.
 *  
 * Some other function can be overrided. I advice you to check the base "PluginInterface" class or go read 
 * the wiki here : https://github.com/SieloBrowser/SieloBrowser/wiki/%5BFR%5D-2.0-Introduction-:-cr%C3%A9ation-de-plugin
